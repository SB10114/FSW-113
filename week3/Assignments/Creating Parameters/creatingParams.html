        The program is recieving the Star Wars API data for each individual person based on thier id. Then the program is displaying the data using the selection from a drop down list to know which id is needed.

        The changes I would make are: 
        Making the veiwing window (the css container) taller to allow more room to read;
        Take the raw JSON and pass it to the DOM, inside of the existing container, in list format for each character id. (without being able to run the changes I am not certain it will work, but this is my theory on how to affect these changes.)
