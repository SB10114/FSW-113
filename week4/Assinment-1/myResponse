My thoughts:

This is a very basic app used to pull information from an API and display it on the DOM. 
I rate it 10/10 for functionality. I rate it 7/10 in terms of flow and aethetics.

What I would change:
I would make minor changes to the layout. 
    ex: Smaller buttons, placed differently on the page to look less blocky. Also the subheader would be centered beneath the banner/image.
